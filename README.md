# Pathfinding Simulation to test Dijkstra's algorithm

Inside the PathFindingSimulation folder is the Java project which was used early in development to test our pathfinding algorithm.

In this simulation, a graph is generated where the nodes represent cities and the edges are the streets that connect these cities.
We then use a version of Dijsktra's algorithm to find a path from the start node to the goal node. The selected path will be highlighted in green in the simulation.

To run a sample simulation, in your terminal or command prompt window run the following commands:

Navigate to the location of the .jar file
`cd PathfindingSimulation\out`

Run the .jar file from the command line
`java -jar simulation-test.jar`

Alternatively, the simulation-test.jar file can be run be simply double clicking it within file explorer
